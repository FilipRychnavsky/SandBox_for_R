    Some talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules
    Of Hector and Lysander, and such great names as these.
    But of all the world's brave heroes, there's none that can compare.
    With a tow, row, row, row, row, row, to the British Grenadiers.

    Those heroes of antiquity ne'er saw a cannon ball,
    Or knew the force of powder to slay their foes withal.
    But our brave boys do know it, and banish all their fears,
    With a tow, row, row, row, row, row, for the British Grenadiers.

    Whene'er we are commanded to storm the palisades,
    Our leaders march with fusees, and we with hand grenades.
    We throw them from the glacis, about the enemies' ears.[N 1]
    With a tow, row, row, row, row, row, the British Grenadiers.

    And when the siege is over, we to the town repair.
    The townsmen cry, "Hurrah, boys, here comes a Grenadier!
    Here come the Grenadiers, my boys, who know no doubts or fears!
    Then sing tow, row, row, row, row, row, the British Grenadiers.

    Then let us fill a bumper, and drink a health of those
    Who carry caps and pouches, and wear the loup√®d clothes.
    May they and their commanders live happy all their years.
    With a tow, row, row, row, row, row, for the British Grenadiers."
